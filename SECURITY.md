## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Ghostkey Server seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them using one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory (Preferred)**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature by going to the Security tab of this repository and clicking "Report a vulnerability"

2. **Email**: Send an email to [security contact email] with the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and provide an initial classification within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve high and critical severity vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices and will coordinate with you on public disclosure timing

### Security Update Process

1. **Assessment**: Our security team will assess the reported vulnerability
2. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
3. **Security Advisory**: We will create a security advisory (if applicable)
4. **Release**: We will release a patched version
5. **Public Disclosure**: We will publicly disclose the vulnerability details after users have had time to update

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Ghostkey Server, please follow these security best practices:

### Environment Setup
- Always use a strong, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY` (minimum 32 characters)
- Enable HTTPS in production environments
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) with proper security headers
- Keep the server updated with the latest security patches

### Database Security
- Use strong database credentials
- Enable database connection encryption when available
- Regularly backup your database
- Limit database access to necessary IP addresses only

### Network Security
- Run the server behind a firewall
- Limit access to the server port (default 5000) to necessary networks only
- Use VPN or other secure access methods for administration
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity

### Configuration Security
- Never commit configuration files with secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Set appropriate file permissions (600) for configuration files
- Regularly rotate secrets and credentials

### Monitoring and Logging
- Enable and monitor application logs
- Set up alerting for suspicious activities
- Regularly review access logs
- Monitor for failed authentication attempts

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Features
- bcrypt password hashing
- Session-based authentication
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection
- Security headers

### Areas of Ongoing Improvement
- Database query optimization to prevent potential DoS
- Enhanced input validation
- Improved logging and monitoring
- Regular security audits

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will include:

- CVE numbers (if applicable)
- Severity assessment (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Affected versions
- Upgrade instructions
- Workarounds (if available)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of coordinated disclosure:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities should be reported privately first
2. **Investigation Period**: We will investigate and develop fixes
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We will work with reporters on disclosure timing
4. **Public Disclosure**: Details will be made public after fixes are available

## Recognition

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers who help keep Ghostkey Server secure. With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution in:
